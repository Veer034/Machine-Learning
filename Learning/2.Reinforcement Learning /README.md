1. Q-Learning:
	This contains the implementation of the Q learning algorithm implementation. Also used matplotlib library to show the UI for 2D Games. In given code can be customised based on the passed argument.

But, as the game progress system will start taking decision based on the reward points for each action. 

2. SARSA : This contains the implementation same as Q- Learning, only difference will be considering point, which can be achieved in second state action.
