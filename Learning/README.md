1. Supervised Learning :Supervised learning is when we finds patterns (and develops predictive models) using both, input data and output data. Supervised learning is divided into classification and regression.


2. Reinforcement learning : It refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to attain a complex objective (goal) or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps; for example, maximize the points won in a game over many moves.
